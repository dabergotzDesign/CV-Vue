        Welcome to the resum√® or curiculum vitae of Dennis Dabergotz. <br>
        Feel free to discover the work I did, the jobs I conquered and see my way through a game called live.
        As it seems like I choosed to play on hard, but the graphics are nice.
      </p>
      <p>
        I follow the way of a more digital side which can be seen in my hobbies and interests, but most on the job side.
        <br>
        Coming from game development and going into web development formed me into a developer in front-end that likes to combine
        both games and web together. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I am open minded, curouis for new and have a heart for the digital media.
